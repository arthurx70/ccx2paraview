# CalculiX to Paraview converter (frd to vtk/vtu)

Converts [CalculiX](http://www.dhondt.de/) .frd-file to view and postprocess analysis results in [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/). Generates Mises and Principal components for stress and strain tensors.

The script generates separate file for each output interval - it makes possible to animate time history. **Caution!** If you have 300 time steps in the FRD, there will be 300 Paraview files. If you need one file - write output only for one step in your CalculiX model.

The script is tested to reduce processing time as much as possible. Now it's quite optimized and fast, but Python itself is slower than C/C++. Here we can do nothing, so, for example, [Calmed converter](https://www.salome-platform.org/forum/forum_12/126338563) must be faster - another question is if it's able to convert any model. This script should: ccx2paraview is tested on all [official CalculiX examples](https://github.com/calculix/examples/tree/master/ccx).

# How to use

Running this software from source is not recommended, because sources are under development and may contain bugs. So, first, [download released binaries](https://github.com/calculix/ccx2paraview/releases), unpack them and allow to be executed (give permissions).

Run the binary with command:

    in Linux:       ./ccx2paraview yourjobname.frd vtu
                    ./ccx2paraview yourjobname.frd vtk
    in Windows:     ccx2paraview.exe yourjobname.frd vtu
                    ccx2paraview.exe yourjobname.frd vtk

It is recommended to convert .frd to modern XML .vtu format. If you have more than one time step there will be additional XML file created - the PVD file. Open it in Paraview to read data from all time steps (all VTU files) at ones.

If you still need VTK format, keep in mind - it doesn't support names for field components. So, for stress and strain tensors components will be numbered as:

    0. xx
    1. yy
    2. zz
    3. xy
    4. yz
    5. zx
    6. Mises
    7. Min Principal
    8. Mid Principal
    9. Max Principal

# For developers

To run this converter from source you'll need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with *numpy*. Install with commands:

    pip3 install numpy
    pip3 install ccx2paraview

In your code use ccx2paraview package in this way:

    import ccx2paraview
    c = ccx2paraview.Converter(frd_file_name, 'vtu')
    c.run()

Create binary with [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/):

    pip3 install pyinstaller
    pyinstaller ./ccx2paraview/__init__.py --onefile

Read [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) about how to create packages for [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/):

    python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel
    python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    twine upload dist/*

Read about VTK [file formats](https://vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/file-formats.pdf) and VTK [unstructured grid](https://lorensen.github.io/VTKExamples/site/VTKFileFormats/#unstructuredgrid). Remember that FRD file is node based, so element results are also stored at the nodes after extrapolation from the integration points ([link](http://www.dhondt.de/ccx_2.15.pdf)).

# TODO

Parse DAT files: it would be a killer feature if Paraview could visualize gauss point results.
